# Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm
The problem statement can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2).  

The code is quite straightforward compared to [yesterday's APL submission](../1/1.md). The only issue I ran into was that for loop variables will happily overwrite globals. Whoops

## Part 1

Normally I have a bad habit of using external programs like `sed`, `cat` or, `grep` in Bash scripts, so I had to consult the [Pure Bash Bible](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible) a few times.  
The first step is convert the input into an array using the following components:
* Set the file separator: `IFS=','`
* Read the input from a file `$(<"input.txt")`
* Read the string as raw input and save it to the "org" array `read -ra org`

```bash
IFS=',' read -ra org <<< "$(<"input.txt")"
```
From here I simply define some functions to make the code somewhat modular. The only "Gotcha" I encountered was that Bash doesn't really _do_ return values, only exit codes. But with the use of a few global variables I managed to get everything working.
```bash
# Set noun and verb
function set_nv () {
        codes[1]=$1
        codes[2]=$2
}

# Execute one step, from index $1
function step () {
	# Bash won't crash on index out of bounds :D
	i1=${codes[$1+1]}
	i2=${codes[$1+2]}
	i3=${codes[$1+3]}
        if [ ${codes[$1]} -eq 1 ]; then
                codes[$i3]=$((${codes[$i1]} + ${codes[$i2]}))
                step_res=0
                return
        elif [ ${codes[$1]} -eq 2 ]; then
                codes[$i3]=$((${codes[$i1]} * ${codes[$i2]}))
                step_res=0
                return
        elif [ ${codes[$1]} -eq 99 ]; then
                step_res=${codes[0]}
                return
        else
                echo "Invalid state"
                echo ${codes[$1]}
                exit 1
        fi
}

# Execute a full run based on a verb and noun
function run () {
	# Restore the codes array
        codes=("${org[@]}")
        set_nv $1 $2
        run_res=0
        i=0
        while [ $run_res -eq 0 ]; do
                step $i
                run_res=$step_res
                i=$(($i + 4))
        done
        return
d
}

run 12 2
echo "Solution for part one: ""$run_res"
```


## Part 2

Now all that's left to do is to use the functions from part 1 and some brute force to find the input variables.
```bash
for noun in {0..99}; do
        for verb in {0..99}; do
                run $noun $verb
                if [ $run_res -eq 19690720 ]; then
                        solution2=$((100*$noun + $verb))
                        break
                fi
        done
done
# Noun and verb will be set to `99` here, hence the `solution2` variable.
echo "Solution for part two: ""$solution2"
```
