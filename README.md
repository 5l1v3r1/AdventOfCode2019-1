# [Advent Of Code 2019](https://rickdejager.github.io/AdventOfCode2019/)

Advent of code is an online advent calendar with daily programming challenges.  
As an extra challenge I will be using a different programming language for each challenge.

## Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation
On the first day God created APL. APL is was developed in 1962 and designed to run on mainframes. Its main strength is that it has a lot of short hand notation for operations over arrays, which made it a somewhat reasonable choice for [day 1](1/1.md).

## Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm
B is for bash. I use bash quite regularly, yet I still have to lookup basic syntax every time... [Day 2](2/2.md)

## Day 3: Crossed Wires
Next up; C++. Definitely not the easiest choice for small, time sensitive programming challenges like this, but I had to keep up the alphabet theme ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. [Day 3](3/3.md)

## Day 4: Secure Container
For day 4 I decided to use Dart. It is pretty similar to JavaScript, but also seems to have inherited some of pythons ease of use. [Day 4](4/4.md)
