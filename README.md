# [Advent Of Code 2019](https://rickdejager.github.io/AdventOfCode2019/)

Advent of code is an online advent calendar with daily programming challenges.  
As an extra challenge I will be using a different programming language for each challenge.

## Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation
On the first day God created APL. APL is was created in 1962 and designed to run on mainframes. Its main strength is that it has a lot of short hand notation for operations over arrays, which made it a somewhat reasonable choice for [day 1](1/1.md).
